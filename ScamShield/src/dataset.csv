"Arre Pooja, kal shopping chalna hai na? Mujhe ek naye top ki zarurat hai. Soch rahi hoon ki ek casual aur ek party wear le loon. Aur mujhe ek matching footwear bhi dekhna hai. Tu kya lene wali hai?",0  
"Hello, Sneha kya tu naye parlor gayi thi last weekend? Mujhe bhi jaana hai. Maine suna hai wahan ka facial aur hair spa kaafi achha hai. Chal na, ek din milke chalte hain, thoda relaxation ho jayega.",0  
"Arre Kavya, kal Riya itni chup kyun thi? Mujhe lagta hai kuch baat hui hai. Uska mood kaafi off lag raha tha. Shayad uska kisi se jhagda hua hai. Kal usse milke baat karte hain, kya pata use humari zarurat ho.",0  
"Hello, Sneha mujhe bata kaunsa dress pehnun kal ki party ke liye—red ya black? Red thoda bold lagta hai, lekin black classy hai. Aur agar black pehnu toh uske saath kaunsa accessory match karega? Teri help chahiye.",0  
"Arre Pooja, suna hai naye ladke aaye hain college mein, ek toh library mein mujhe ghoor raha tha. Mujhe toh thoda ajeeb laga, lekin shayad woh mujhse baat karna chahta ho. Tujhe lagta hai mujhe usse baat karni chahiye?",0

"Hello, Sameer kya Sneha kaafi time se tujhe ignore kar rahi hai? Mujhe lagta hai tu usse directly baat kar. Ek acha hairstyle aur thoda formal attire pehen kar usse mil, mujhe lagta hai woh tujhe seriously legi.",1  
"Arre Abhi, kal ke cricket match ke baad jo ladki tumse baat karne aayi thi na, mujhe lagta hai woh interested hai. Next time usse milte waqt ek acha denim jacket aur sneakers pehn lena. First impression zaruri hai.",1  
"Hello, Yash mujhe lagta hai ki tu Shreya ke birthday par uske liye ek acha gift le ja. Aur haan, ek stylish kurta pehen kar jaana, woh ethnic look mein tujhe zarur notice karegi. Tujhe kya lagta hai?",1  
"Arre Rohan, kal ki class ke baad Ananya kaafi time tak tumhare saath thi. Mujhe lagta hai ki woh tumse impress hai. Agar tu uske saath aur time spend karega, toh uska trust jeet lega. Bas confident rehna.",1  

"Arre Rohan, kal ki party ke liye kya pehnne ka plan hai? Main soch raha hoon apna white shirt aur blue blazer pehnu, woh Shreya ko kaafi pasand hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki agar main thoda formal look rakhoon, toh uska impression aur achha hoga. Waise shoes ke liye soch raha hoon brown leather wale pehnu. Tujhe kya lagta hai, main usko impress kar paunga ya aur kuch better karoon?",1  

"Arre Sameer, suna hai ki Sneha tujhe dekh kar smile kar rahi thi kal cafeteria mein. Mujhe toh lagta hai ki woh tujhe pasand karti hai, warna itni attention nahi deti. Tu kyun nahi usse baat karta? Party mein ek chance le le na. Main toh kehta hoon ki tu ek acha sa shirt pehen aur apne baalon ka style thoda change kar. Mujhe lagta hai agar tu confident hoke baat karega, toh woh zarur impress hogi.",1  

"Hello, Abhi kal Ananya ka birthday hai, mujhe samajh nahi aa raha kya pehnu. Soch raha hoon ek casual jacket aur sneakers pehnu, jo thoda cool lage. Lekin mujhe lagta hai ki formal attire better hoga, jaise ek white shirt aur black pants. Waise gift ke liye kya le? Mujhe lagta hai ek perfume ya ek cute teddy bear achha rahega. Tu kya suggest karega, kuch aur better idea hai kya?",1  

"Arre Yash, kal jo ladki tumhari taraf dekh rahi thi na, mujhe lagta hai uska interest hai tum mein. Uska style aur tarika mujhe toh wahi dikhata hai. Party ke liye acha suit pehn lena, aur usse confidently baat karna. Waise ek acha perfume laga lena, woh cheez girls ko impress karne ke liye zaruri hoti hai. Bas confident rehna bhai, baaki ho jayega. Aur haan, ek smile mat bhoolna jab baat karega, woh sabse important hai!",1  

"Hello, Rohan kya tu Shreya se baat karne wala hai kal? Mujhe lagta hai agar tu apna black shirt pehne aur thoda perfume lagaye, toh woh zarur impress ho jayegi. Uske baad agar tu usse casually baat kare aur ek-do compliments bhi de de, toh baat ban jayegi. Waise tu uska favorite color pata kar le, aur agar possible ho toh ussi range ka dress pehen. Mujhe lagta hai sab perfect hoga agar tu confident rahega.",1  

"Arre Vivek, kal ki party mein Priya kaafi acchi lag rahi thi na? Mujhe toh lagta hai ki uska interest hai tujh mein. Agar tu usse baat karna chahta hai, toh kal ek acha casual outfit pehn le jaise ek denim jacket aur white t-shirt. Waise ek acha sa compliment mat bhoolna, jaise ki 'tumhari smile bohot achhi lagti hai'. Mujhe lagta hai agar tu ye karega toh woh khush ho jayegi aur interest aur badh jayega.",1  

"Hello, Sameer kya Sneha kaafi time se tujhe ignore kar rahi hai? Mujhe lagta hai tu usse directly baat kar. Ek acha hairstyle aur thoda formal attire pehen kar usse mil, jaise ek white shirt aur black blazer. Mujhe lagta hai woh tujhe seriously legi agar tu thoda confident aur mature behave karega. Waise ek chhota sa gift le ja na uske liye, jaise ek flower ya chocolate, woh zarur impress ho jayegi.",1  

"Arre Abhi, kal ke cricket match ke baad jo ladki tumse baat karne aayi thi na, mujhe lagta hai woh interested hai. Next time usse milte waqt ek acha denim jacket aur sneakers pehn lena, jo thoda stylish lage. Waise baat karte waqt uski hobbies ke baare mein puchh lena ya uska favorite sport. Girls ko pasand hai jab ladke unki baatein genuinely sunte hain. Bas first impression zaruri hai, isliye confident rehna.",1  

"Hello, Yash mujhe lagta hai ki tu Shreya ke birthday par uske liye ek acha gift le ja. Waise ek stylish kurta pehen kar jaana, woh ethnic look mein tujhe zarur notice karegi. Ek-do tareef karna mat bhoolna jaise ki 'tumhare dress ka color tum par bohot suit kar raha hai'. Usse zarur accha lagega. Aur haan, party mein thoda time uske aas paas rehne ki koshish kar, mujhe lagta hai woh isse khush hogi.",1  

"Arre Rohan, kal ki class ke baad Ananya kaafi time tak tumhare saath thi. Mujhe lagta hai ki woh tumse impress hai. Agar tu uske saath aur time spend karega, toh uska trust jeet lega. Waise kal ke liye ek acha casual look rakhna, jaise ek plain t-shirt aur jeans. Uske saath casual aur funny baatein karna, lekin thoda uska mood samajhna bhi zaruri hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki woh tumhare baatein enjoy karegi.",1
