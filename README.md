Hello Everyone,


Below project is the solution the ps of one of the india's largest hackathon , Innerve 9 , organized by AIT, Pune. I with my team named Techno Titans , has created the solution to this problem. As this is one of the sponsored problem statement by Josh Technical Groups , which makes it more exciting.


# üõ°Ô∏è ScamShield: Real-Time Scam Call Detection üõ°Ô∏è


**Stop phone scams before they start.  ScamShield is an AI-powered mobile application that provides real-time protection against scam calls, especially for vulnerable users and those speaking Indian languages.**

## The Urgent Problem: Phone Scams are Exploding

Phone scams are a pervasive and devastating problem, with traditional spam filters offering no defense against live, conversational fraud. Scammers are sophisticated social engineers, and their tactics are becoming increasingly complex.  Our research underscores the urgency:

## ScamShield:  AI-Powered Real-Time Protection

ScamShield is a revolutionary approach to phone security. We go beyond simple number blocking, using cutting-edge AI to analyze the *conversation itself* as it happens. ScamShield provides:

*   **Instant Scam Detection:**  Our fine-tuned DistilBERT AI model, leveraging Natural Language Processing, analyzes speech in real-time for scam indicators.
*   **Proactive, Actionable Alerts:**  When a scam is detected, ScamShield immediately alerts the user with clear warnings and suggests actions to take, empowering them to hang up and stay safe.
*   **Privacy-First Design:**  We prioritize user privacy. While demonstrating cloud deployment for this hackathon, our vision includes complete on-device processing for maximum security.
*   **Adaptive AI - Always Learning:** ScamShield's backend is built for continuous improvement. With user feedback, our AI model learns and adapts to new scam tactics, ensuring long-term protection.
*   **Empowering Education:**  ScamShield isn't just about technology; it's about user empowerment.  We include a built-in educational module to inform users about scam tactics and prevention, a feature users overwhelmingly requested.
